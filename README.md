Welcome Brother Burton to my final project! :) 


----------------------------------------------------

List of top priority ("must have") requirements.
1)The program needs to give to the user random shapes so the user can move them using the arrow keys
2)The shapes need to move down each time that they appear on screen
3)If the user matches completely one line with the shapes, this line needs to disappear (needs to be removed from the screen)
4)If the shapes touch the top of the screen, the game is over, the user needs to organize the shapes so they can disappear.



List of lower priority ("nice to have") requirements:

5)A box displaying the incoming shape that will show up on screen
6)Each shape will be a different flag
7)Some sounds each time the user matches the shapes in a line, also it would be nice to add some sounds when the user starts the game and when it is game over
8)A box showing the score/ points (when the user matches a line)
