Programing with Classes course

----------------------------------------------------


Welcome Brother Burton to my final project! :) 


----------------------------------------------------

List of top priority ("must have") requirements.
1)	The program needs to give to the user random shapes so the user can move them using the arrow keys
2)	The shapes need to move down each time that they appear on screen
3)	If the user matches completely one line with the shapes, this line needs to disappear (needs to be removed from the screen)
4)	If the shapes touch the top of the screen, the game is over, the user needs to organize the shapes so they can disappear.
