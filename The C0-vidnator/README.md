Programing with Classes course

----------------------------------------------------


Welcome Brother Burton to my final project! :) 


----------------------------------------------------

List of top priority ("must have") requirements.
1) The user can use the arrows to move the main actor (the sanitizer)
2) The program need to display 4x12 covids in the window with the propper padding and position at the top of the screen
3) The covid's need to move right to right, and they need to shoot at the sanitizer (main caracter)
4) Everytime the sanitizer hits with the attack (the blue ball) one of the covid's, the covid needs to disappear 
5) Sounds! one playing on the background while the user is playing the game, and other sounds for everytime the attack is hitting one of the covid's or the sanitizer

----------------------------------------------------

List of lower priority ("nice to have") requirements.
1) The title of the game showing on the right corner of the screen
2) The course title (CSE210) showing on the left corner of the screen
3) 2-3 masks need to be right above of the sanitizer, so everytime the covid's are shooting, the main character (sanitizer) can hide under the masks in order to avoid the attacks (the masks will work as a barrier/shield)

## Required Technologies
